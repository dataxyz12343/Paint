Paint

This is my second project with Pygame !

I got inspired by some random YouTube videos and thought i could do a simple version of Paint.

In my program:
   + Users draw by thousands of rectangles
   + There's a topbar to visually choose colors and display the instructions about keys.
   Users can:
     + Draw with different colors ( Keys: Q|E )
     + Use eraser, then they can switch back to the previous color ( Key: W)
     + Change size of the rectangles ( Keys: ARROW KEYS )
     + Change the speed of size handling ( Keys: Z|X )
     + Save the drawing ( Key: S )
     + Dispaying the latest saved drawing ( Key: D )



                                                                 Tan
